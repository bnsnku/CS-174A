I was able to fulfill the basic requirements of the project by using the code from the textbook, including 
	1. Getting a canvas to display
	2. implementing shader codes to get primitives onto the screen.
	3. Implementing the Sierpinski Gasket algorithim using recursive triangles, with (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5) and (0.0, 0.5) as the initial seed points of the algorithm
	4. Code is commented

For the extra credit, I was able to 
	1. Implement an application based color variable passed to the fragment shader

	2. Implement a keyboard method to change the color and redisplay

	3. I was able to switch to a blank screen and switch back to the Sierpinski Gasket, but I was unable to get new points to display

	I found an algorithim for the Mandelbrot fractal, but did not have time to implement it.

	4. Implement a rotation of 10 deg clockwise using the built-in functions in the MV.js file
